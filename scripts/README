Before running the preprocessing.py file, you should get the Lang-8 dataset 
and run extract_err-cor-pair.py file first. preprocessing.py file requires the 
result file after running extract_err-cor-pair.py file.

When running extract_err-cor-pair.py, set the argument l2 as Korean to extract
data of Korean language learners.
